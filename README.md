# Murder_Mystery
In this project, i analyzed data using sql 
I solved a crime where i had to figure out who commited murder within a given dataset
I searched the date the crime was reported in SQL city, then used information such as Security footage, first witness, seconnd witness, address number, Id, plate number ect, to arrive at the most likely suspect of the crime. Retrieving a name and plate number.
